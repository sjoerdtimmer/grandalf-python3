#  Edge routing algorithms.
#  These are mosty helpers for routing an edge 'e' through
#  points pts with various tweaks like moving the starting point
#  to the intersection with the bounding box and taking some constraints
#  into account, and/or moving the head also to its prefered position.
#  Of course, since gandalf only works with bounding boxes, the exact
#  shape of the nodes are not known and the edge drawing inside the bb
#  shall be performed by the drawing engine associated with 'views'.
#  (e.g. look at intersectC when the node shape is a circle)

#  basic edge routing with lines : nothing to do for routing
#  since the layout engine has already provided to list of points through which
#  the edge shall be drawn. We just compute the position where to adjust the
#  tail and head.
